[# 53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

> Easy

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.


Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
