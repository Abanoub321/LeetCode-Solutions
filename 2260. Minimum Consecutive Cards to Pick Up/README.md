#[2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-consecutive-cards-to-pick-up/)

> ## Medium

You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the **value** of the `ith` card. A pair of cards are **matching** if the cards have the **same** value.

Return the **minimum** number of **consecutive** cards you have to pick up to have a pair of **matching** cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return `-1`.


**##Constraints:**
- `1 <= cards.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= cards[i] <= 10^6`
