### **Why TypeScript**

As you can see, all the code and tests are written in TypeScript. There's no particular reason for me to use TypeScript while solving problems other than I'm familiar with it.
Most of the code take huge time or space which is not considered due to solving the problem is the priority.

### **How to Use the Tests**

You'll need this only if you want to play with the code and try new things, or if you want to contribute to the project.

```bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Abanoub321/LeetCode-Solutions

# Installing the needed dependencies
$ npm install

# Running the tests
$ npm test

```
