> ## Medium

iven an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`

**Follow-up:**

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?
