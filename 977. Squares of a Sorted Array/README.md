# [977. Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)

> ## Easy

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, return an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.`

**Follow-up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?
